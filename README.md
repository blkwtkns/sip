# quick-gulp-setup

A personally built task runner meant for rapid development geared towards front-end static pages with minimal setup. It currently watches, bundles and auto-reloads the browser when changes are made to SCSS, JS files, and a main html file.

Modules used in this setup include:

- browser-sync
- browserify
- gulp-sass
- gulp-uglify
- vinyl-buffer
- vinyl-source-stream

Will add an image optimizer soon!
